# My-own-voice-based-assistant

I have developed a voice-controlled home automation system from scratch using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors. Our program, coded in Python, interprets voice commands from users and executes corresponding actions. Additionally, users receive important messages via a Telegram bot we created. We utilize different Python APIs for real-time data, such as the Google Cloud Speech API for voice-to-text conversion, weather APIs for current weather data, and other libraries for obtaining the current time and day.

This project aims to create a Raspberry Pi-based voice assistant similar to Alexa, capable of listening, responding, and controlling various functions. We have implemented speech recognition directly on the Raspberry Pi, allowing users to connect a microphone and issue commands. In this report, we will discuss our project's implementation and areas for potential improvement.
